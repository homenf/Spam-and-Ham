Hello all,

We've added another option to stretch your creativity for assignment three! Instead of writing three short fiction pieces and mixing them with transmedia, you have the option to instead create a poem on Twitter:


Form: Inspired by various experiments going on in the form of poetry on the Twitter platform, such as Childish Gambino’s poem about being called a “white rapper” (https://www.dailydot.com/irl/donald-glover-ferguson-twitter-poem/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.), write a poem that is designed for / and released on Twitter.

Your poem should be comprised of about 20 tweets or “stanzas”. Each tweet should be about 60 words, give or take a few words. Each tweet should "pack a punch." It should be able to stand alone, even though it is part of a larger poem. The whole poem should be approximately 1200 words in total.

Each tweet should be released on Twitter, in order, at intervals. The exact times at which you release these tweets are up to you, but all tweets should be released by the due date.

Optional: your poem can, but doesn’t have to, include images or links to relevant articles.
