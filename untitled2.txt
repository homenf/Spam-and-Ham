To submit: Upload your poetry to twitter.

Next, screen shot each tweet and upload your screen shot files to Canvas.

Finally,  in the comments section on Canvas, you will submit your @Twitter handle, and the # you have used to title and track your poem.

Please tag your instructor @mossisnice, and add @ubccrwr too!

 

Subject: Your Twitter poem should be a response to a current cultural trend or social issue. The nature of the issue or trend should be made clear to the reader in the text of the poem.

 

Grading: as with the rubric for the Transmedia tumbler assignment, you will be graded on innovation, craft, and voice. Unlike the Tumbler assignment, however, you will not be graded on Transmedia choices. Instead, we will create a category called “Relevance” that looks at how well your poem speaks to the social issue or cultural trend it addresses. For further details on the rubric, Please take a look at the Tumblr assignment.
